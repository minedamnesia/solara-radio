              <p>Hi! I'm Kelly, otherwise known as KK7QEA. I have had an amateur radio license since December 2023, when I first started as a Technician, and I moved up to General in 2024 after building my first antenna—a simple 10M dipole that got me hooked. These days, I usually operate with a Xiegu G90 and an end-fed halfwave or random wire, depending on the setting.</p>
              <p>I’m a member of the Henderson Amateur Radio Club, and as of July 5, 2025, I hold an Extra class license. Lately, I’ve been spending more time on digital modes like FT8, where I enjoy the efficiency and reach of low-power contacts.</p>
              <p>I’m especially drawn to portable operations and try to activate parks whenever I can—POTA has become a favorite part of the hobby. I’ve even attempted a SOTA activation, though it ended up being more of a hike than a contact success.</p>
              <p>By day, I work as a software developer writing Python. Off the air, I enjoy hiking, gardening, art, music, stargazing, and time outdoors with my very curious dog.</p>
              <p>Hope to connect on the bands soon. 73!</p>
